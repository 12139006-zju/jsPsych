# Exclude Participants Based on Browser Features

Online subjects will use many different kinds of browsers. 
Depending on the experiment, it may be important to specify a minimum feature set of the browser. 

As of v7.1 of jsPsych, the recommended way to do this is using the [browser-check plugin](../plugins/browser-check.md). This plugin can record many features of the subject's browser and exclude subjects who do not meet a defined set of inclusion criteria. Please see the [browser-check plugin documentation](../plugins/browser-check.md) for more details.
